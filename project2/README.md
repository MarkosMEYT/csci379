The rapid increase in data related to food has spurred improvements in machine learning, especially in recognizing images. The Food-101 dataset, which is part of the TensorFlow library, offers an excellent opportunity to test how well different deep learning models can identify images of 101 types of food. In this study, we compared the performance of three advanced CNNs — ResNet50, DenseNet, and InceptionV3 — in recognizing food images. We made sure the Food-101 dataset was ready for use and used transfer learning to adjust the pre-built models for our task. Our approach was organized and included fine-tuning model settings, using data augmentation to make the dataset more varied, and using ensemble methods to get better at predicting. The results gave us valuable information about how the speed of computation and the accuracy of the models balance each other out. This provides a detailed resource for future use in identifying food through images. The outcomes of this research are useful not just for academic reasons but also for improving how users experience food-related applications, and they contribute to the wider conversation about recognizing images through artificial intelligence.
