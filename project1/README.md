The Blocks World is a classic problem in artificial intelligence involving a set of blocks and a set of actions that can be performed on these blocks. In this project, we propose an AI system that tackles the Blocks World problem by generating a sequence of scenes (states) that transition from an initial configuration of blocks to a desired goal configuration. Our algorithm is designed to handle any combination of five blocks (A, B, C, D, E) and their relations (AIR, ON, CLEAR, TABLE), allowing for a flexible and versatile approach to solving the problem. Our algorithm also attempts to solve the case if there is a triangle instead of a block shape. Attempt to solve the problem with efficient time and space complexity.
